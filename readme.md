# Reddit comment undeleter

This is a simple script that saves reddit comments which have been deleted within the first 15 minutes (configurable) after being created.

## Installation

Install the requirements with
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to create a .env file with your own credentials. Click "create another app..." [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) then select "script" from the options to make your own bot application.

## Usage

You can run the script with
```bash
py bot.py
```

## License

I literally don't care.

## Random thoughts

I have had some concerns about uploading this. On one hand it's probably a helpful resource for people trying to make a reddit bot, on the other it's morally questionable. I have decided to upload it because it was really simple to make. If I can make this bot with little effort, someone with malicious intent can easily make something like this anyways. Maybe they already have.

I guess digital permanence is real.
